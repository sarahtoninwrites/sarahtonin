This is my portfolio website! Made to showcase my skills and interests, it's still a work-in-progress as I hone my skills and focus on improving everyday!

Feel free to use this template:

To run on your device:
1. Install zip/ clone repo
2. install dependencies such as python and flask (I've used Tailwind and Bootstrap via CDN, so there's no need to isntall those)
3. In your VS Code terminal, while making sure you're in the correct directory, type "python app.py" OR "flask run"
4. You're good to go!
